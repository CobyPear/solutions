# Word Guess Game

The page generates a random word (only 1 of 3 at the moment) for the user to guess one letter at a time.

The page renders the word as underscores. The underscores are replaced with the proper letter if the user guesses the right letter by typing it on their keyboard.

The application keeps track of the user's wins and losses.
